# Satellite Collision Detection

This project detects potential satellite collisions using real orbital data
and the SGP4 propagation model.

## Tools Used
- Python
- sgp4 library
- Real TLE satellite data

## Features
- Calculates distance between satellites
- Detects close-approach collisions
- Optimized initial distance checking

## How to Run
```bash
pip install sgp4
python main.py
