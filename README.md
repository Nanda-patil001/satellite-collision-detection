# 🛰️ Satellite Collision Detection System

## 📌 Project Description
This project detects potential collision risks between satellites by calculating the distance between them using orbital data (TLE – Two Line Element sets).  
The SGP4 orbital propagation model is used to predict satellite positions over time.
